|          Semtech SX1278 firmware for STM8S003                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This firmware currently supports the following Semtech LoRa product:
	- SX1278
		- LoRa modem (application default)

1. Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SX12xx drivers are included in a project made for the STM8S003 platform. Currently my development hardware is STM8S003 discovery kit (STM8SVLDISCOVERY) plus SFM-1L SX1278 LoRa module.	

1. Version history
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<1.0.0> - This is original project from STM which SX1278 radio driver is not ported.

<3.1.0> - Enable SPI hardware to improve RX/TX performance. 

<3.2.0> - Increase baud rate to 128000.

<3.3.0> 
- Add in some debugging code which can be disabled by commenting MALIYU_DEBUG in project option->Preprocessor.
- Change LoRa signal bandwidth from 10.4KHz to 500KHz to improve the response time.
- Disable some functions to save code space.

<3.4.0>
- Store firmware version into eeprom. It can automatically store it as long as the different version is detected.
- Implement host ID & remote ID so that only predefined host ID & remote ID are allowed. 
- Add command at+on=[host ID],[remote ID] and at+off=[host ID],[remote ID]. At here, host ID and remote ID must be two bytes. Another word, the firmware can support max 99 host and each host can support total 99 remote controllers.

<3.4.1> - Add command "at+version=?" to retreive firmware version through UART.
