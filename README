|          Semtech SX1278 firmware for STM8S003                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This firmware currently supports the following Semtech LoRa product:
	- SX1278
		- LoRa modem (application default)

1. Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SX12xx drivers are included in a project made for the STM8S003 platform. Currently my development hardware is STM8S003 discovery kit (STM8SVLDISCOVERY) plus SFM-1L SX1278 LoRa module.
